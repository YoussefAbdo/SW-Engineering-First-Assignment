1.A class is an expanded concept of a data structure: instead of holding only data, it can hold both data and
functions.
An object is an instantiation of a class. In terms of variables, a class would be the type, and an object would be the
Variable.
Classes are generally declared using the keyword class.
2.Abstract classes define what a set of classes can do 
Abstract classes is used to define the methods their derived classes must implement. 
can contain common methods that can be used by all derived classes. 
can use the default behavior or replaces it with its own variation. 
3.A class is a definition of the behavior of an object Objects are instances of classes
4. class data member are preferred to be set as private and class function are set as public.
5. The answer is in cpp file
6. constructor is automatically called
whenever a new object of this class is created. This constructor function must have the same name as the class,
and cannot have any return type; not even void.
The destructor fulfills the opposite functionality. It is automatically called when an object is destroyed.
7. The answer is in cpp file
8. If you do not declare any constructors in a class definition, the compiler assumes the class to have a default
constructor with no arguments.
10. “this” is an implicit parameter of member function of a certain object which contain object address.
“*this” it returns the object itself.
